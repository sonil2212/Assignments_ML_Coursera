function centroids = computeCentroids(X, idx, K)
%COMPUTECENTROIDS returs the new centroids by computing the means of the 
%data points assigned to each centroid.
%   centroids = COMPUTECENTROIDS(X, idx, K) returns the new centroids by 
%   computing the means of the data points assigned to each centroid. It is
%   given a dataset X where each row is a single data point, a vector
%   idx of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K]) for each
%   example, and K, the number of centroids. You should return a matrix
%   centroids, where each row of centroids is the mean of the data points
%   assigned to it.
%

% Useful variables
[m n] = size(X);

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
centroids = zeros(K, n);
%printf("size is %d %d",size(centroids));


% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Go over every centroid and compute mean of all points that
%               belong to it. Concretely, the row vector centroids(i, :)
%               should contain the mean of the data points assigned to
%               centroid i.
%
% Note: You can use a for-loop over the centroids to compute this.
%

%disp(idx);

for i=1:K
	[tf,s_idx]=ismember(idx,i);
	temp=find(s_idx)';
	%printf("temp is %d %d",size(temp));
	%x_mean=sum(X([temp],1))/size(temp,2);
	%y_mean=sum(X([temp],2))/size(temp,2);
	for j=1:n
		j_mean=sum(X([temp],j))/size(temp,2);
		centroids(i,j)=j_mean;
